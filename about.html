                As a person who graduated from science high school and Political Science and International Relations
                department of Boğaziçi University, I worked as a
                tax specialist in
                international companies for about 3 years. This may seem a bit confusing with considering all of my
                interests however, I think all of these will
                have a positive
                impact on my future career and I am trying to combine my skills.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-muted">
                With starting my career as a Transfer Pricing Consultant, I have prepared many Benchmark
                Studies which require me to visit many websites of companies in different industries. In this
                process, I found some of the websites very organized and visually appealing, while others I did not.
                To learn how to develope a better one, I attended to SheCodes Web Develeopment bootcamps in which I
                learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React and built projects with these skills.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-muted">
                In my career, I also realized that there are too many aspects in Tax and Transfer Pricing which can be
                automatized with understanding the data initially.
                Realizing this grew my curiousity toward Data and I attended Big Data and Business Analytics Program in
                Istanbul
                Technical
                University in which I learned about Python, R, Matlab and Knime. Now, I continue my journey with
                Information Technology Masters Degree in Bahçeşehir University. Coding and learning about technology
                became my new interests with fun practices.
